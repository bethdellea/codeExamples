When running the FileSimulator file, enter the number of tree units desired for the width and height when prompted, and then a decimal representation
of how likely trees are to catch fire in this simulation.
The simulation will only spread fire to a location where it does not already exist, and only one where there is 
a square directly in contact with it which is currently on fire. Each fire state only lasts for one step of the simulation.
The simulation will then run, with fire sounds in the background, for ambiance.
 In this version of the simulation, there are pictures for the states, as well, though the pictures get cut off 
 when there are too many squares in the grid. This simulation also works if you switch out the commented code for the pictures code.
 (The pictures and audio are the bonus portions of this code.)
